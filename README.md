Web Design Final Project

  This was a final project for CS 145 at Montana State University. Completed my freshman year. The only issues my proffesors
  spotted was in a design flaw. The design flaw was not having the current page be designated in any way. Fell free to 
  check it out. This is one of my very first projects so suggeestions are very much welcome at this point.
